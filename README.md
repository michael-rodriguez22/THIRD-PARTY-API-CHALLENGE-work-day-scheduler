# Rhythm Shift
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser. Events can be saved to local storage, and will persist even if the page is closed and reopened. Events are also color coded based on if the given hour is in the past, present, or future. Here is a screenshot of the app.
